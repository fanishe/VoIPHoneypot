# Nmap OS Fingerprinting 2nd Generation DB. -*- mode: fundamental; -*-
# $Id$
#
# Contributions to this database are welcome.  If Nmap obtains a new
# fingerprint (and test conditions are favorable), it will print out a
# URL you can use to submit the fingerprint.  If Nmap guesses wrong,
# please see https://nmap.org/submit/ .
#
# By submitting fingerprints you are transfering any and all copyright
# interest in the data to Insecure.Com LLC so it can modified,
# incorporated into Nmap, relicensed, etc.

# This first element provides the number of points every fingerprint
# test is worth.  Tests like TTL or Don't fragment are worth less
# (individually) because there are so many of them and the values are
# often correlated with each other.  Meanwhile, elements such as TS
# (TCP timestamp) which are only used once, get more points.  Points
# are used when there are no perfect matches to determine which OS
# fingerprint matches a target machine most closely.
